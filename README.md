# Fichas Star Wars

This app will help you to generate a character sheet for the **Star Wars Fudge rpg**.

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

## Build & development

Run `gulp` for preview.

`gulp resetDB` will clean the persist folder and set the default values (app/defaultDB)-

To reload the navigator automatically when something changes, the installation of [the livereload extension for chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei) is required. Don't forget to enable it in the app's tab!.

Feel free to contribute with your ideas!
### Upcoming

* Add/edit force powers.
* Anything you suggest that sounds good.
